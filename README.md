# ZoddJoin

ZoddJoin is a Kotlin Project that targets the [Sponge](https://spongepowered.org/) platform for Minecraft.

The purpose of this plugin is to allow you to configure join and leave messages.

This plugin was heavily inspired by [FrozenJoin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/frozenjoin.93473/)
